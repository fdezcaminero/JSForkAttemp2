# JSProyectoUno

Interactive Library. The code easily searches through an array of books. It can also add new books and remove old ones.

## Instructions

The code comes with four books in the library. Although it would work just as fine if the library were empty. You can search through the library with the 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons.

You can use the toggle '...' button to change the status of a book from 'Not Read' to 'Read', or vice versa. 

Click the 'REMOVE BOOK' button to permanently delete books from the library array. The library will update to the book on the same index you just deleted. If that index doesn't exist anymore, the library will update to the last book on the array.

And with the 'ADD BOOK' button you can create a new Book object for the array, with all the required parameters. If you change your mind and don't want to add anything, just press 'Cancel'.
